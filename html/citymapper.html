                <p>The feature design project was an opportunity to introduce a new feature within Citymapper, a well-used mapping software for commuters. By exploring and implementing new features, this project aims to elevate the existing Citymapper experience. The new added features should be instantly intuitive and efficient for existing user experience. </p>

                <h2>First stage:</h2>
                <br>
                <p> The first stage to our feature design was to research Citymapper and its existing features and goals. We conducted five Ask and Watch interviews, questioned interviewees how Citymapper differs from their preferred mapping software, their public transportation habits and pain points, and how they felt when using Citymapper. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Findings:</h2>
                <br>
                <li>Prioritized the fastest route, with fewest transfers</li>
                <li>Frustrations with overcrowding on transit</li>
                <li>Concerns regarding transit safety</li>
                <li>Weather conditions</li>
                <li>Incorrect ETAs provided by apps</li>
                <li>Transit systems of new cities being confusing</li>
                <br>
                <p>We concluded the initial stage of the design by narrowing down areas of focus from the personas we have created. The areas of focus that we decide on were:</p>
                <br>
                <li>Transit experience regarding wait times, possible delays, and capacity</li>
                <li>Transit safety and conditions</li>
                <li>Unfamiliar transit systems and locations for tourists</li>

            <h2>Second Stage</h2>
            <br>
            <p>From the first stage of the ideation phase, our group further narrowed down our design intent. We focused on places of interest, itineraries, as well as a group traveling feature.

                        <h3>Places of Interest</h3>
                        <p>Thomas proposed Places of interest, which focused on helping tourists better explore unfamiliar cities and providing tourists with options and ideas of possible things to do along transportation routes. This feature works by displaying a list of places of interests and providing additional details for users to learn more about the destination based on a refined criteria. </p>

                    <div class="three-item">
                        <h3>Itineraries</h3>
                        <p>  Carissa developed Itineraries, which focused on assisting travellers in planning out trips that have more than one stop and allows for quic kaccess to travel plans to reduce friction in getting to the next destination during the day. Itinerary leverages the existing “saved location” feature by allowing users to add on group destinations, reorder destinations based on preference, and make additional reference notes when starting a route. </p>

                    <div class="three-item">
                        <h3>Groups</h3>
                        <p>   I implemented Groups, which focused on accommodating for travel time differences for group members with different starting points. This helps to alleviate the stress of meticulously planning group departure times and ETA uncertainty. Groups builds on top of the share destination and trip tracking by allowing users to create groups with other users to share and view locations, as well as access ETA of each group member to a shared destination. </p>

                <br>
                <p>The final stage of our feature design involved refining our idea until we were able to sort out any logistic errors. In addition, we had to make sure that we were able to stay consistent with the brand language and UI elements. I was able to further develop the group editing feature, while Thomas worked on the main-navigation menu, and Carissa worked on the Groups live-location. </p>

                <p>Adding a new feature into an existing brand was a challenge for my team. Understanding the nuances and goals of the stakeholders involved in this project was important to our success. Not only did we have to understand relevant stakeholder goals, we needed our feature to be intuitive and robust enough to consider many different interactions. Ethical concerns regarding being able to see other members live-location was another pressing issue for our team to solve.

Finally, we implemented an option for users to turn live-locations on and off to protect the privacy of our users.

                <p>Throughout this project, our team focused on creating a new feature that was both useful to users and aligns with Citymapper goals. We conducted in-depth research, including user interviews and usability testing. From the research, we identified user pain points and preferences. This allowed us to develop a clear and intuitive feature that builds upon the existing UI of Citymapper. My team was able to create a new feature on Citymapper that addressed the pain points we identified in users. The new Groups feature allows for further enhancement to the overall Citymapper user experience.
